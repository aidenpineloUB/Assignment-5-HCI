      <h2>Vector Graphics Editors I've Used Before</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Figma:</strong> I’ve used it extensively and found it user-friendly with a great free education plan.</li>
        <li><strong>Adobe Illustrator:</strong> I’ve also used Illustrator for vector graphic tasks, but it felt overwhelming at times due to its vast array of features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Task Overview</h2>
      <p>For this exercise, I used Sketch for the first time to design a business card as part of a corporate identity project. My task involved creating a double-sided 3.5 × 2 in business card and exporting it as an SVG file.</p>

      <h2>What I Found Challenging</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Exporting Files</h3>
        <p><strong>Pain Point:</strong> Finding the export option was unexpectedly difficult. I looked for it in the usual File menu but couldn’t locate it there. It was tucked away in the bottom-right corner of the interface, and I had to scroll down to see it.</p>

        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> After unsuccessfully searching for a while, I Googled how to export files in Sketch and finally located it.</p>
        <p><strong>Screenshot:</strong> (Attach a screenshot of the export menu for clarity.)</p>

      <h2>What I Found Easy</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Tool Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Most tools and features were where I expected them to be. For example, creating shapes, adding text, and aligning elements felt intuitive. The overall simplicity of the interface made it easy to focus on the task without being overwhelmed by excessive options.</p>

        <h3>Learning Curve</h3>
        <p>Sketch’s minimalist design significantly reduced the learning curve. Compared to Adobe Illustrator, Sketch felt much more approachable for a beginner. The interface was straightforward, and I didn’t have to consult external guides for anything except exporting.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>The task was completed quickly and efficiently. Once I understood where the export option was, the entire design and export process took less than an hour.</p>

      <h2>How Sketch Compares to Figma and Adobe Illustrator</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
        <p>Sketch ranks highest in terms of learnability for me. Its clean, uncluttered interface makes it a fantastic tool for someone new to vector graphics editing. Figma is also user-friendly but feels slightly more feature-dense. Adobe Illustrator, while powerful, has a steep learning curve and can be overwhelming due to its extensive features.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Exporting Process</h3>
        <p>Figma and Illustrator have their export options more intuitively placed (e.g., File > Export). Sketch’s placement of the export option in the bottom-right corner felt non-intuitive.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Design Simplicity</h3>
        <p>Sketch’s minimal interface made the overall experience more enjoyable than both Figma and Illustrator, which can feel busier.</p>

      <h2>Time Taken</h2>
      <p>The entire task (designing and exporting the business card) took approximately 45 minutes. Most of this time was spent on the design, while the challenge with exporting added about 5–10 minutes.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Suggestions for Improving Learnability</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reposition Export Options:</strong> Moving the export feature to the File menu or another easily visible location would enhance the user experience and reduce confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Built-in Hints:</strong> Adding hover-over hints or a “Getting Started” tutorial for new users could make it easier for beginners to navigate the interface.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Using Sketch was a fast, straightforward, and enjoyable experience. Compared to Figma and Adobe Illustrator, I found Sketch to be the most learnable due to its minimal design and intuitive layout. Despite a minor hiccup with exporting, I would highly recommend Sketch for users who are new to vector graphic editing.</p>
